Sketch of the main idea:
------------------------

The three scripts in this directory were used to obtain the critical exponents gamma and nu of the ferromagnetic Ising Model in two dimensions, with the correct critical temperature given.
The Idea is to collapse the data (specifically the function chi(beta)) for different lattice sizes N to a single curve (only in the critical region).
Hereby, the collapse is possible due to the scale invariance in the critical range of the system with a second order phase transition.
The axes are gradually rescaled by the critical exponents and the linear lattice size L=\sqrt{N} during the gradient descent method. The performance of the collapse is measured by a loss function that is to be found in the "gradient_descend.py" script.

Firstly, it is necessary, to define a list of discrete beta values and a list of different lattice sizes (i.e. number of sites) N.
For each N, Monte Carlo simulations have to be run for each beta returning a raw_data csv file (for each beta). Putting all these generated files together as the "_reprocessed_data_wolf.csv" file delivers the data foundation for the computations of the three scripts.

- The "combine_csv_reprocessed.py" script can be used to create the "_reprocessed_data_wolf.csv" file
- Calculate the partition functions ("partition_function.py") for each beta for each N and store them in a csv file ("Z_beta_N=##.csv") as in the dummy file.
- Use the "gradient_descend.py" to perform the gradient descent and calculate the exponents. Hereby, the program requires all the "Z_beta_N=##.csv" files and the "_reprocessed_data_wolf.csv" that was previously used in the calculation of the partition function.
- The "interpolating_quantities.py" script can be used to explicitly interpolate a certain quantity Q based on the Monte Carlo simulations, requiring the same files as the "gradient_descend.py".
